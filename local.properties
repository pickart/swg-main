# Settings in here will override those in build.Properties
# Use this file for your own settings
# This file is gitignored so changing this file will not interfere will pulling updates

# Example:
# Uncomment this line to override build.properties and name your cluster whatever you want instead of naming it swg
#cluster_name = Skywalker
